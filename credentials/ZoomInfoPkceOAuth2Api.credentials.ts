/**
 * Authorization-code + PKCE auth for the ZoomInfo GTM API, and the node's only
 * credential: the user is redirected to the ZoomInfo login, signs in with their
 * own username and password, and the workflow then acts as that specific
 * ZoomInfo user, with their entitlements.
 *
 * Caution for unattended workflows: ZoomInfo rotates refresh tokens and each one
 * is single-use. If two executions of the same workflow refresh at the same
 * moment, one of them invalidates the other's token and the credential has to be
 * reconnected by hand. Keep concurrency at 1 on schedules that run unattended.
 *
 * A client-credentials credential was considered and dropped: it removes the
 * rotating-token hazard, but it also removes per-user attribution, and it
 * requires the `client_credentials` grant to be enabled on the DevPortal app —
 * which is not the default, so the common outcome was an `unauthorized_client`
 * dead end for anyone who picked it.
 *
 * This is also the credential n8n's Managed OAuth targets. `clientId` and
 * `clientSecret` are deliberately not declared here: they are inherited from
 * `oAuth2Api`, which is the hook Managed OAuth fills in. On Cloud, n8n supplies
 * both from ZoomInfo's shared app and the user only sees a connect button;
 * everywhere else the user registers their own DevPortal app and enters the pair
 * by hand. Every other property stays `hidden` so neither path can misconfigure
 * an endpoint. See https://sites.n8n.io/managed-oauth-guidelines.
